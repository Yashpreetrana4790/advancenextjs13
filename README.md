# Stack Overflow Clone

This is a full-stack application created by Yash using **MongoDB** and **Next.js 14**. The application serves as a clone of Stack Overflow, featuring a reputation and badge system. It includes various components such as job vacancies, community tags, and a question page. The components are server-rendered and reusable, utilizing Next.js's server actions for efficient data handling.
